The approach uses algorithms and tools of designers and engineers in relation to a wide range of tasks. <br /> The workshop is interactive: theoretical blocks alternate with practical assignments. As a result, of the workshop, participants will be able to get basic understanding of design thinking and use studied techniques into their working routine.",

We'll also discuss search and outreach strategies to help you in actually finding the right people. During the workshop we'll introduce and start working on a few templates and frameworks to help you kickoff your search. Please bring a laptop, or notebook + pen!",

One of the methods is better suited for analysis of customer journeys and UX flows, and the other for technical architecture and system design. Both are geared towards producing actionable backlog items. We will also discuss how threat modelling can be integrated in your development flow to produce ongoing evidence, should you ever need to seek some sort of certification for your product.We're looking for examples we could use as practice targets. If you have either of the following and are open for discussing them openly, please contact us:• A customer journey map or an epic (a bundle of user stories) with external customers • A technical design, preferably application & orchestration level one with external connections and multiple back-end services.",
